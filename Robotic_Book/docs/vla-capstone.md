# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Welcome to Module 4, where we explore Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems that represent the integration of perception, language understanding, and physical action in humanoid robots. This paradigm enables robots to understand natural language commands, perceive their environment, and execute complex tasks in human-centered environments.

## Overview

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems create a seamless pipeline where natural language commands are directly translated into coordinated physical actions, with visual feedback continuously informing and adjusting the execution. This module covers the complete integration of voice interfaces, cognitive planning with Large Language Models, vision-language grounding, and the implementation of a comprehensive capstone project.

This module is organized into five chapters that progressively build your understanding:

1. [Chapter 1: From Language to Action in Robotics](./vla/chapter-1-language-to-action.md) - Understanding VLA systems and the role of LLMs in robot cognition
2. [Chapter 2: Voice-to-Action with Speech Models](./vla/chapter-2-voice-to-action.md) - Speech recognition pipelines and OpenAI Whisper integration
3. [Chapter 3: Cognitive Planning with Large Language Models](./vla/chapter-3-cognitive-planning.md) - LLM-based task decomposition and ROS 2 action mapping
4. [Chapter 4: Vision-Language Grounding](./vla/chapter-4-vision-language-grounding.md) - Linking visual perception with language for object reference resolution
5. [Chapter 5: Capstone Project – The Autonomous Humanoid](./vla/chapter-5-capstone-project.md) - Complete end-to-end system integrating all VLA components

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will understand:

- How VLA systems integrate perception, language, and action in humanoid robots
- The implementation of voice interfaces using modern speech recognition models
- How Large Language Models serve as cognitive planners for robotic tasks
- The techniques for grounding language references in visual perception
- The complete architecture for an autonomous humanoid robot system

The VLA approach demonstrates the integration of all previous modules, creating robots capable of natural interaction and complex task execution in human-centered environments.
