# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2, where we explore digital twin technology for humanoid robotics. This module covers the essential simulation platforms and techniques that enable safe, cost-effective development and testing of humanoid robots before deployment to physical hardware.

## Overview

Digital twins provide virtual replicas of physical systems that enable simulation, testing, and optimization. For humanoid robots, digital twins are particularly valuable due to the high cost of hardware, safety considerations, and the need for extensive testing of complex behaviors. This module covers both physics-focused simulation with Gazebo and high-fidelity visualization with Unity.

This module is organized into five chapters that progressively build your understanding:

1. [Chapter 1: Introduction to Digital Twins in Robotics](./digital-twin/chapter-1-introduction.md) - Understanding digital twin concepts and their importance for humanoid robots
2. [Chapter 2: Physics Simulation in Gazebo](./digital-twin/chapter-2-physics-simulation.md) - Core physics simulation concepts and Gazebo capabilities
3. [Chapter 3: Environment Building & World Modeling](./digital-twin/chapter-3-environment-modeling.md) - Creating simulated environments and testing scenarios
4. [Chapter 4: High-Fidelity Simulation with Unity](./digital-twin/chapter-4-unity-simulation.md) - Visual realism and human-robot interaction in Unity
5. [Chapter 5: Sensor Simulation for Humanoid Robots](./digital-twin/chapter-5-sensor-simulation.md) - Accurate modeling of robot sensors and perception systems

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will understand:

- How digital twins bridge the gap between simulation and real-world robot deployment
- The physics simulation capabilities of Gazebo for humanoid robot development
- Techniques for building realistic simulated environments for testing
- How Unity complements Gazebo with high-fidelity visualization
- The importance of accurate sensor simulation for sim-to-real transfer

Digital twins using both Gazebo and Unity provide comprehensive simulation capabilities for humanoid robots, enabling development and testing in safe, controlled virtual environments before deployment to physical hardware.
