# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1, where we explore the foundational communication infrastructure that enables humanoid robots to function as integrated systems. This module covers the essential concepts of Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) and how it serves as the nervous system for robotic platforms.

## Overview

ROS 2 provides the communication backbone for humanoid robots, enabling different software components and hardware systems to interact seamlessly. Just as the nervous system enables communication between different parts of the human body, ROS 2 enables communication between different parts of a robot.

This module is organized into four chapters that progressively build your understanding:

1. [Chapter 1: Middleware for Robot Control](./ros2/chapter-1-middleware.md) - Understanding the purpose of middleware in robotics and DDS basics
2. [Chapter 2: ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services](./ros2/chapter-2-nodes-topics-services.md) - Core ROS 2 concepts and communication patterns
3. [Chapter 3: Bridging Python Agents to ROS Controllers using rclpy](./ros2/chapter-3-rclpy-bridge.md) - Connecting AI agents to robotic systems
4. [Chapter 4: Understanding URDF for Humanoids](./ros2/chapter-4-urdf-humanoids.md) - Robot description and modeling for humanoid platforms

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will understand:

- How middleware enables distributed robotic systems to communicate effectively
- The core concepts of ROS 2 architecture and communication patterns
- How to bridge AI agents written in Python with robotic controllers
- How to represent humanoid robots using URDF for simulation and control

ROS 2 provides the essential infrastructure for building complex humanoid robots, enabling different components to communicate effectively while maintaining modularity and scalability. This forms the foundation for higher-level AI systems to control the robot's behavior.
